# Internet Enhancement Suite (IES)
Help make the internet better at [ies.znewton.xyz](https://ies.znewton.xyz).

## App
The app portion is where a user can 'live' edit css/js that gets put into a mocked version of whatever site they are using.


## Server
I think this will be where the CSS/JS gets added to the css/js files that are being hosted in the mock website frame.

Mock site will be hosted at `/<random_site_id>`.

## Chrome Extension
This is the vital part that allows a user to enable/disable a site's enhancements. Enhancements will have `Security Reviewed` tags if they have been checked for malicious code. Otherwise, a user can view the code or just YOLO it and enable it anyways.
